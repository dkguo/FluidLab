This codebase contains the following:
- **FluidEngine**, a multi-material fully-differentiable physics engine, supporting liquids, solids, and gasesous fluid simulation.
- **FluidLab**, a set of standardized complex (robotic) fluid manipulation tasks powered by FluidEngine.

## Installation
### Basic environment
Clone git repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/zhouxian/FluidLab.git
```
We recommend working with a conda environment.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fluidlab
```
If installing from this yaml file doesn't work, manual installation missing packages should also work.

Finally, install FluidLab.
```
cd FluidLab/
pip install -e .
```

### Rendering
FluidLab comes with two different rendering choices: GGUIRenderer and GLRenderer.

#### 1. GGUIRenderer
GGUIRenderer (`fluidlab/fluidengine/renderers/ggui_renderer.py`) is based on Taichi's own UI system: [GGUI](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/ggui).
GGUIRenderer is fast and the recommended way for quick visualization and prototyping.

#### 2. GLRenderer
GLRenderer (`fluidlab/fluidengine/renderers/ggui_renderer.py`) is an OpenGL-based GPU-acelerated rendering pipeline. It produces much better visual effects.

GLRenderer is slower than GGUIRenderer: while the rendering itself is pretty fast, the major bottleneck occurs in GPU-CPU-GPU data transfer from simulation to the renderer. We are currently working on addressing this.

Part of GLRenderer is modified from Nvidia FleXâ€™s rendering pipeline. We enhanced it with various features tailored to FluidLab's use, including particle-level colorization, headless rendering, dynamic object loading, volume rendering for smoke field, etc. We also provided a set of python APIs to dynamically update the scene configuration from within Python. The renderer supports rendering materials as either particles or fluids. 

GLRenderer is developped in C++ and needs to be compiled first. Sadly, compiling only works with cuda 9.2, but we provided a docker file to make it easy.

First, install docker-ce and nvidia-docker following the official steps:
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker

Compile GLRenderer using our provided docker file. (Assuming you are using anaconda3)

```
sudo docker build -t fluidlab-glrenderer fluidlab/fluidengine/renderers/gl_renderer_src

sudo docker run \
  -v ${PWD}/fluidlab/fluidengine/renderers/gl_renderer_src:/workspace \
  -v /home/{username}/anaconda3:/home/{username}/anaconda3 \
  --gpus all \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -e QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
  -it fluidlab-glrenderer:latest bash

. /home/{username}/anaconda3/bin/activate fluidlab
. prepare.sh
. compile.sh
```
If you see the following console output, the compilation is successful, and you are free to exit the docker environment.
```
[100%] Linking CXX shared module flex_renderer.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
[100%] Built target flex_renderer
```

## Let's Rock!
### Generate goal
Let's start with the Latte Art (Pouring) task as a concrete example.
First, we need to generate a goal pattern. We provided a hard-coded sinewave pattern by default:
```
python fluidlab/run.py --cfg_file configs/exp_latteart.yaml --record
```
A GUI window pops up and visualizes the pattern generation process. After this, the generated goal pattern will be saved as `fluidlab/assets/targets/LatteArt-v0.pkl`.
The above command uses GGUIRenderer by default. If you want to switch to GLRenderer, simply append `--renderer_type GL` at the end:
```
python fluidlab/run.py --cfg_file configs/exp_latteart.yaml --record --renderer_type GL
```
Instead of using the hard-coded sinewave pattern, you can also generate the goal by controlling the agent using you mouse (and keyboard in other examples), simply by appending `--user_input`. It is recommended to switch back to GGUIRenderer in this case because speed matters for interactive control:
```
python fluidlab/run.py --cfg_file configs/exp_latteart.yaml --record --renderer_type GGUI --user_input
```
Now you can use your mouse to control the pitcher and generate a goal pattern you want.

Once a target is generated, you can replay it:
```
python fluidlab/run.py --cfg_file configs/exp_latteart.yaml --replay_target
```

### Trajectory optimization with differentiable physics
Now that we have the goal, we will optimize a trajectory using gradients provided by the differentiable simulation.
```
python fluidlab/run.py --cfg_file configs/exp_latteart.yaml --exp_name exp_latteart
```
Optimized trajectories will be saved under ```logs/policies/{exp_name}```.

### Replay optimized trajectory
```
python fluidlab/run.py --cfg_file configs/exp_latteart.yaml --replay_policy --path logs/policies/exp_latteart/0100.pkl
```

### Misc
If you would like to use GLRenderer for liquid, remember to modify the opacity value of the corresponding material in `macro.py`. For example, the last element in `COLOR[WATER]` should be set to `0.0`.
